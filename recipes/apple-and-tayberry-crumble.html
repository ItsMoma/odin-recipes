        <p>A tasty harvest treat. Pairs perfectly with cream or cornish clotted ice cream!</p>
        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <h3>For the crumble:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>180g plain flour</li>
            <li>90g caster sugar</li>
            <li>90g melted unsalted butter</li>
            <li>A handful of granola and/or mixed seeds</li>
            <li>1tbsp ground cinammon</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>For the fruit compote:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>300g/approx. 5 apples, ideally braeburn</li>
            <li>150g tayberries. I pick mine from my garden! If you can't find any tayberries, blackberries also work well.</li>
            <li>30g unsalted butter</li>
            <li>30g demarera sugar</li>
            <li>1tsp ground cinammon</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 190c.</li>
            <li>Mix your flower (seived) and caster sugar in a bowl until combined.</li>
            <li>Add melted butter to mixture and mix with your hands in pinching motions until a crumble forms. Be careful not to overwork it! Stop when the crumble is at a density you like.</li>
            <li>Pour your crumble mix onto a baking sheet and put in the oven for 15 minutes or until lightly coloured. When finished, take out and leave to the side to cool.</li>
            <li>While that's cooking, peel your apples and cut them into approximately 2cm chunks, or whatever size is desired.</li>
            <li>Put your unsalted butter and demarera sugar into a saucepan and heat over low until the butter is melted and a light caramel forms- about 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add your apple pieces and heat for another 3 minutes, stirring frequently.</li>
            <li>Add your tayberries and cinammon and heat for another 3 minutes. Stir infrequently so the tayberries aren't turned to mush, but make sure everything is mixed.</li>
            <li>Take off the heat and pour into a large ceramic dish. Disperse your crumble mix evenly on top, and finish with granola and seeds, if desired.</li>
            <li>Reheat in the oven for 10 minutes, and serve immediately. Optionally pair with ice cream, cream, or custard.</li>
        </ol>
